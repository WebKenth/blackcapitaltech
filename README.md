# Black Capital Technology - Website Analysis Platform

## Project Vision

We are transforming Black Capital Technology's business model from traditional AI consulting to a scalable lead generation platform through intelligent website analysis. This project reimagines how we capture and convert prospects by providing immediate value through comprehensive website audits.

## Current State vs Future Vision

### What We Have Now
The current website ([ai-guide.blackcapitaltechnology.com](https://ai-guide.blackcapitaltechnology.com/)) positions BCT as an AI consulting firm with impressive credentials:

- **Enterprise Portfolio**: Novo Nordisk, Ørsted, Vestas, Nordea, SKAT, Københavns Universitet
- **Industry Reach**: Pharmaceuticals, energy, finance, healthcare, government, education
- **Proven Track Record**: 95% customer satisfaction, 40% efficiency improvements, 100+ clients
- **Business Model**: High-touch consulting with 3+ year average partnerships

**The Problem**: This model doesn't scale. Each client requires significant manual effort and long sales cycles.

### What We're Building
A lead generation machine disguised as a valuable free service - a comprehensive website analysis platform that:

1. **Attracts prospects** with immediate, actionable value
2. **Qualifies leads** through company intelligence gathering
3. **Demonstrates expertise** through detailed technical analysis
4. **Captures contact information** for follow-up sales processes
5. **Scales infinitely** through automation

## Key Questions & Decisions Needed

### Business Strategy
1. **Pricing Model**: Should the basic analysis remain completely free, or introduce a freemium model?
2. **Target Market**: Focus on Danish companies (CVR integration) or expand internationally?
3. **Follow-up Strategy**: How aggressive should the sales follow-up be after analysis delivery?
4. **Service Positioning**: Position as "free audit" vs "lead qualification tool"?

### Technical Scope
1. **Analysis Depth**: How comprehensive should the free analysis be? (Risk of giving away too much value)
2. **Processing Time**: Balance between thorough analysis and quick delivery
3. **Report Format**: PDF download, web dashboard, or email delivery?
4. **Integration Requirements**: CRM integration, email marketing tools, analytics platforms?

### Implementation Priorities
1. **MVP Scope**: What's the minimum viable analysis that provides value?
2. **Lighthouse Pages**: Should we analyze 25 pages or start with 5-10?
3. **CVR Integration**: Essential for launch or nice-to-have?
4. **Security Analysis**: Basic checks or comprehensive security audit?
